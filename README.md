# AI-App
This's an app you can write your entries. By AI power, it can tell you what the mood of your journal entry is. And it would try to analysis what you were feeling, saying, how you feel that day(pos or neg).

U can ask it, how i felt that day? Was i in a bad mood this month?... AI will give you answer.

We don't need to know anything about the ai algorithm, just need to know how to call the api of openAI.
